**“Introduction to Data Analysis and Visualization in R” Workshop**

I independently developed and implemented a course that aims to equip students with basic data analysis and visualization skills in R. I emphasize understanding of the R language itself and hence the course begins with an introduction to the syntax of R. This is so that students who complete the course will be able to learn more R independently. The course focuses on the use of Tidyverse and ggplot2 packages. There are five sessions in the course and each session will cover important concepts and functions at each stage of the data visualization process. Each session will be accompanied with exercises in R for practice in class and after class. An original data sample was constructed for these exercises. By the end of the course, students should be able to navigate R to perform basic exploratory data analysis. 

The most recent iteration was completed in January 2022. 

Course structure:<br>
Lesson 1: Basic syntax in R and exploring data<br>
Lesson 2: Data cleaning and data transformation <br>
Lesson 3: Basic syntax of ggplot2 <br>
Lesson 4: Aesthetics, attributes, and faceting in ggplot2<br>
Lesson 5: Enhancing visualizations in ggplot2<br>

**Writing Workshop for Political Science Undergraduate Students** <br>

I created and launched a workshop series, “Reading and Writing Arguments”, targeted at political science undergraduate students. The workshop sessions explore approaches to reading in political science and getting started on the research process. The sessions also discuss techniques for writing research papers. The outline is available <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d31deaf24ec13000175a6d8/t/5d9804a0bd4c1842802573b1/1570243745469/Writing+Workshop+Outline+%28as+of+Oct+5%29.pdf">here</a>.
