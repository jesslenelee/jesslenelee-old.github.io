I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto. My research interests are in the subfields of International Relations and International Political Economy. My research is motivated by the central question: how do rising powers affect global economic governance? I am particularly interested in examining how rising powersâ€™ international economic engagement in the areas of development finance and trade supports or challenges the rules, norms, and institutions of existing global economic governance. I explore these theoretical puzzles through empirical research on the rise of China. My current projects revolve around the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative. I received my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from the National University of Singapore.
