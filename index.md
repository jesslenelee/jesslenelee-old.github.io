I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Toronto. My research interests include international relations and political economy, with a focus on the politics of trade, international institutions, institutional change, and rising powers. My research is motivated by the central question: how do rising powers affect global economic governance? I am particularly interested in examining how rising powersâ€™ international economic engagement in the areas of trade and development finance supports or challenges the rules, norms, and institutions of existing global economic governance. I explore these theoretical puzzles through empirical research on the rise of China. My current projects revolve around the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative. 

I have a Master of Social Sciences and Bachelor of Social Sciences in Political Science from the National University of Singapore. Previously, I have studied at Fudan University, Seoul National University, and the University of Tokyo.
