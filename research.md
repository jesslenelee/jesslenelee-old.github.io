“Gaining Ground, Gaining Influence? Vote Shares and Power in the AIIB” (with A/P Soo Yeon Kim)

<p style="margin-left: 40px"> This paper examines the distribution of power in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the relative influence of states in the institution, in comparison to that in existing international institutions. A comparative analysis of the institutional design of the AIIB and other institutions informs the hypothesis: states’ vote shares in the AIIB are shaped by their respective vote shares in other institutions, conditioned on states’ founding member status, regional member status, and developing status. The findings suggest that most states gain in vote shares in the AIIB, relative to their vote shares in other institutions; this increase in vote share – and thus relative influence – is larger for states at lower levels of development. This paper contributes to literature on the distribution of power in international institutions, as well as the impact of international institutions created by rising powers on global governance. </p>

“Reshaping Connectivity? Mapping China’s Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Trade Network”

<p style="margin-left: 40px"> This paper analyzes the impact of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on the global trade network. More specifically, the paper examines whether infrastructure development from BRI investments fosters trade relations that coincide or contrast with the existing arrangements of trade relations in the global trade network. Tools of economic geography and network analysis will be used to identify and examine trade relations among BRI countries. Existing literature contend with the spatially differentiated and often staggered economic effects of the BRI, emphasising intra- and inter-country experiences. This paper extends on this by considering these effects of the BRI within and across countries as part of a broader system and in network terms. This paper argues that infrastructure development from BRI investments fosters shifts in the composition and balance of trade relations, but trade relations are still largely aligned to the existing patterns of the global trade network. Yet, while not constituting a reshaping of connectivity, as of now, the trade effects of the BRI should not be overlooked for the maturation of present infrastructure development could result in longer-term distributional consequences on the global trade network. </p>
